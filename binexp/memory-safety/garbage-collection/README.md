# Garbage Collection

Garbage Collection is a form of **automatic memory management**, used by (often) higher-level programming languages to remove the need for complicated manual memory management.

The two main types are [Tracing Garbage Collection](tracing-garbage-collection.md) (which is often just referred to as "Garbage Collection") and [Automatic Reference Counting](automatic-reference-counting.md).
