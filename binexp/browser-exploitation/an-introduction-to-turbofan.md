# An Introduction to Turbofan

## What is Turbofan?

All JavaScript code is JIT compiled, meaning it is first converted into **bytecode** before being executed as machine instructions. In V8, the interpreter responsible for this bytecode is called [**Ignition**](https://v8.dev/docs/ignition), and as such we can refer to the intermediate bytecode as **ignition bytecode**.

One of the benefits of JIT compiling the javascript involves the collection of **feedback** from the Ignition interpreter. Often-executed functions get **optimized** to be faster and more efficient - this is the job of **Turbofan**.

## Speculative Optimizations

The optimizations made by Turbofan are based off **assumptions** (hence speculative) - it will attempt to optimize the code for whatever object types and logic flows it expects to meet.

For example, let's say we're programming a game. In this game, you are a soldier, and your job is to hold off the invading aliens. Holding them off by force, the `kill()` function is regularly called on aliens. Turbofan recognises this, and generates **optimized code** for running the `kill()` function. With such a large number of calls to the function, the optimization is massively helpful. Go Turbofan!

&#x20;But, once again, this optimization is **speculative** - the original code generated by Turbofan is optimized for running `kill()` on **aliens**. Let's say that the player ends up being overwhelmed, and `kill()` is called on the player themselves. Suddenly, turbofan's speculation is **incorrect** - the optimized code is incredbly quick, but only for aliens! The type passed to `kill()` here is a `Player`, so this optimization cannot be used. Turbofan has to destroy this optimzation and generate some ignition bytecode instead in a process called **deoptimization**.

Deoptimzation has a huge performance cost, and is very desirable to avoid. As a result, Turbofan will optimize the code once again, if `kill()` continues to be called on both aliens and players. Turbofan will speculatively optimize the code to handle both alien _and_ player objects, clawing back the performance benefits - maybe not entirely, but far better than generating ignition bytecode every time.
