# Heap

Moving onto heap exploitation **does not require you to be a god at stack exploitation**, but it will require a better understanding of C and how concepts such as pointers work. From time to time we will be discussing the glibc source code itself, and while this can be really overwhelming, it's incredibly good practise.

I'll do everything I can do make it as simple as possible. Most references (to start with) will be hyperlinks, so feel free to just keep the concept in mind for now, but as you progress understanding the source will become more and more important.

{% hint style="info" %}
Occasionally different snippets of code will be from different glibc versions, and I'll do my best to note down which version they are from. The reason for this is that newer versions have a lot of protections that will obscure the basic logic of the operation, so we will start with older implementations and build up.
