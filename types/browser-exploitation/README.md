# Browser Exploitation

This is going to document my journey into V8 exploitation, and hopefully provide some tools to help you learn too.

To start with, we're going to go through \*CTF's OOB-V8 challenge, mostly following [Faith's brilliantly in-depth writeup](https://faraz.faith/2019-12-13-starctf-oob-v8-indepth/). From there, well, we'll see.

[Saelo's classic V8 paper](http://www.phrack.org/issues/70/9.html) is also a goldmine.
