# Cybersecurity Notes

Welcome to my blog! There's a lot here and it's a bit spread out, so here's a guide:

* If you're looking for my binary exploitation notes, you're in the right place! Here I make notes on most of the things I learn, and also provide vulnerable binaries to allow you to have a go yourself. Most "common" stack techniques are mentioned along with some super introductory heap; more will come soonâ„¢.
* There is the odd set of things on reverse engineering, cryptography and blockchain security too, as well as writeups
* All of my non-cryptography maths notes can be found on Notion [here](https://ir0nstone.notion.site/Maths-3bb97c269fdc4dde810a3bb3ef9780f1?pvs=4). I realise having it in multiple locations is annoying, but maths support in Notion is just wayyy better. Like _so much better_. Sorry.

If you'd like to find me elsewhere, I'm usually down as **ir0nstone**. The account you'd actually be interested in seeing is likely [my HackTheBox account](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/249013).

If this resource has been helpful to you, please consider [supporting me on buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ir0nst0ne) :)

And, of course, thanks to GitBook for all of their support :)
