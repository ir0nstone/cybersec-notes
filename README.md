# Binary Exploitation Notes

Welcome to my blog! There's a lot here and it's a bit spread out, so here's a guide:

* If you're looking for the binary exploitation notes, you're in the right place! Here I make notes on most of the things I learn, and also provide vulnerable binaries to allow you to have a go yourself. Most "common" stack techniques are mentioned along with some super introductory heap; more will come soonâ„¢.
* If you're looking for my **maths** notes, they are split up (with some overlap):
  * Cryptography-specific maths can be found on GitBook [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MHfP44c-IQ\_Syc\_GT2Z/), or by clicking the hyperlink in the header
  * All my other maths notes can be found on Notion [here](https://ir0nstone.notion.site/Maths-3bb97c269fdc4dde810a3bb3ef9780f1?pvs=4). I realise having it in multiple locations is annoying, but maths support in Notion is just wayyy better. Like _so much better_. Sorry.
  * Hopefully these two get moulded into one soon

If you'd like to find me elsewhere, I'm usually down as **ir0nstone**. The accounts you'd actually be interested in seeing are likely [my HackTheBox account](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/249013) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ir0nstone) (or X, if you _really_ prefer).

If this resource has been helpful to you, please consider [supporting me on buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ir0nst0ne) :)

And, of course, thanks to GitBook for all of their support :)
